## SilentSpeak
This is a video calling app specifically for the DHH community, it generates realtime predictions from the sign languages (ASL) and displays it live on the video call as captions
  
Video call to your friend without registering. 
Simply send your friend your auto-generated unique ID to make the call.  
Everytime you open a new tab, the server gives you a totally different unique ID.
